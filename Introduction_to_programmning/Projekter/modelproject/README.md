# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **OLG** and model a OLG model with the extention of a PAYG system. Further we vizualise the capital for both versions of the model and show that the genreal model has a higher level of capital per capita.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [OLG.ipynb].

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
