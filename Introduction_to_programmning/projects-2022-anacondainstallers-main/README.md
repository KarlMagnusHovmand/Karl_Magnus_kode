This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. In this project we analyze the benchmark model of insurance policies, Mossin's insurance model. We examine the agents optimal insurance coverage, optimal insurance contract for agent and insurance company and do a montecarlo integration finding the profit maximizing premium.
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Statistikbanken** on **fuel prices and vehicle prices** and show that there is no clear relation in general.
3. Model project. We model an OLG model and extend the model with a Pay As You Go system. We find that the optimal capital accumulation is higher for a genereal OLG model than a model with a PAYG system.
4. The exam project. Which demonstrates data handling in an analysis of windmills, model solving in a consumer problem aswell as creating an algorithm.
